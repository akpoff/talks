About My Talks Repo
===================

This is the repository for talks I give at conferences. The *src*
directory contains the org-mode files I use to generate the talks. The
*slides* directory is a hierarchical list of conferences by year.

I will usually post the original slides as given during the talk and
possibly a corrected set if I find spelling mistakes or other
infelicities of grammar, usage, punctuation or facts.

About Making Beamer Slides in Org-mode
--------------------------------------

I write my talk using [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) and export them
using [beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)). The
process is not difficult. Read the
[tutorial](http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html) on
the [worg](http://orgmode.org/worg/).

Copyright and License
---------------------

Unless noted otherwise in the file itself, the org-mode files, slides
and images are released under a the Attribution 4.0 International (CC
BY 4.0) license.

**Note**: There may be content in the talks that's included under
  [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use). I try to
  document these uses where possible but may miss some.
