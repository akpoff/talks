About My Talks Repo
===================

This is the repository for talks I give at conferences. The *src*
directory contains the org-mode files I use to generate the talks. The
*slides* directory is a hierarchical list of conferences by year.

I will usually post the original slides as given during the talk and
possibly a corrected set if I find spelling mistakes or other
infelicities of grammar, usage, punctuation or facts.

About Making Beamer Slides in Org-mode
--------------------------------------

I write my talks using [org-mode](http://orgmode.org) and export them
as [beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) slides. The
process is not difficult. Read the
[tutorial](http://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html) on
the [worg](http://orgmode.org/worg/).
