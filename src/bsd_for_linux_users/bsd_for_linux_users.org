* What is BSD?
** What is BSD? Then
   + Berkeley Software Distribution
     - Not "Berkeley System Distribution"
   + Direct descendant from AT&T Unix
     - Brought to Berkeley (/alma mater/) when Ken Thompson took sabbatical in 1975
   + Developed by Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) UC Berkeley
   + Active from 1977 to 1995
   + Began as tape of various programs and utilities
   + Ended as nearly complete operating system
     - 6 files still "encumbered"
** What is BSD? Then cont
   + 4.4BSD-Lite final version
   + Numerous technologies, programs and other free-software ideas originated or propagated in BSD
     - ed, vi & csh
     - Pascal compiler
     - Berkeley Sockets
     - Berkeley Fast File System
     - BSD license (4-, 3- and 2-clause versions)
     - First Unix to have virtual memory
   + The Lawsuit
     - USL sued BSDi and U-Cal Berkeley over licenses
     - Eventual settled when UCB showed USL had violated UCB copyright
     - (Yeah, that's a very short version of the lawsuit history.)
   + https://www.mckusick.com/history/index.html
** What is BSD? Now
   + Family of Unix-like operating systems
     - Different focus by project
   + Not quite like a Linux distribution
     - Kernels and userland began life at 4.4BSD-Lite, diverged
     - Share code between projects, collaborate
   + BSD licensed
   + Developed as a complete OS
     - Kernel plus userland
   + Emphasis on documentation
   + Very POSIX compliant
   + Application software from "ports"
     - Similar to packages
     - Historically built-on-demand
     - Now most BSDs offer binaries as well
** Notable BSD Systems
   + SunOS
   + FreeBSD
   + NetBSD 
   + OpenBSD
   + MacOS
   + DragonFlyBSD

* BSD for Linux Users
** Unique Features and Technologies
   + Install on ZFS (FreeBSD)
     - Snapshot entire OS
   + clang/llvm
   + Jails (FreeBSD)
     - Mature technology
     - Lighter than VM
     - Separate IP(s) for Jail
     - Delegate ZFS to Jail users
   + PF + CARP
     - Build high-availability firewall and routing appliances
** Key Differences - System
   + Almost universally installed in cli
     - PC-BSD has graphical installer
   + Init
     - No systemd
     - BSD rc system (/etc/rc.d/<daemon> start|stop|reload|status)
     - No procfs (emulation on some BSDs via package)
     - sysctl works via system calls
   + Kernel
     - Rarely need to build custom kernel
     - Most have kernel modules (OpenBSD does not)
     - Other than security patches, usually upgraded with system
** Key Differences - System cont
   + Base OS
     - The group of programs and utilities that make-up the BSD
     - Ports and packages are usually developed in step with BSD (ABI compatibility issues)
       + FreeBSD ports from any major release work with any minor of that release
   + Upgrading varies by BSD
     - OpenBSD upgrades base then packages
       + Two branches: current and stable
       + Nearly daily snapshots based on current
     - FreeBSD has freebsd-update for patches, security updates and full upgrades
       + Can also track development branches
** Key Differences - Userland
   + Shell
     - Default shell tends to be ksh and csh (bash available)
     - Mostly POSIX or original Unix/BSD implementations
       + Very few gnu user utils (can be found in packages)
   + Users
     - Wheel group for sudoers
   + Miscellaneous
     - vi is vi, not vim (packages)
     - tmux rather than screen (packages)
   + Install packages:
     - OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD: pkg-add <pkg-name>
     - FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD: pkg install <pkg-name>
** Key Differences - License
   + BSDs are licensed under one of BSD licenses
     - Great for companies that want to keep some secret sauce
     - Doesn't mean they do...many give back
       + Netflix
       + Verisign
       + Juniper
       + Apple
   + Goal is to get high-quality software into as many hands as possible
   + Freedom to use code how the end-user wants
   + This is a war just waiting to happen so let's move on
** Software Availability
   + Flash - almost non-existent (PC-BSD)
   + Enterprise, web and other software
     - Apache, nginx
     - MySQL, Maria, Postgres, Memcached, Redis
     - Puppet, Salt, Chef
     - Nagios, Wireshark
     - couchDB, hadoop
     - Docker containers (FreeBSD docker-freebsd)
   + Productivity:
     - FireFox, Chromium
     - KDE, Gnome, XFCE
     - LibreOffice, TeX, LaTeX
   + Dev: practically everything
   + 25,128 ports in FreeBSD tree
** Hardware Support
   + Excellent hardware support in the server room
     - Multiple CPUs (with or without Hyperthreading)
     - Support for AES-NI, VT-x, VT-d
   + Very good support at the desktop
     - Varies by BSD
     - PC-BSD/FreeBSD very good
     - OpenBSD very good
     - NetBSD 7 looking very good (@justincormack)
   + Graphic Card Support
     - Excellent: Intel
       + DragonFlyBSD very good with latest Intel integrated graphics
     - Very good: Nvidia, AMD
       - Excellent Nvidia-maintained drivers for FreeBSD (PC-BSD)
       - No CUDA dev but perhaps under Linux emulation
** Hardware Support
   + Other
     - USB 3
     - AHCI (including hotplug)
     - RAID cards (including HBA cards <- very useful with FreeNAS)
     - NICs (10 Gig E)

** BSD in Production
   + theanimenetwork.com
     - Ran on OpenBSD until moved to AWS
     - relayd
     - Apache 1.3.1 (OpenBSD-maintained version)
     - MySQL
** Why Use BSD?
   + Avoid mono-culture -> Verisign model
   + Prefer system-as-a-whole development model
   + ZFS + Jails for process isolation
     - Much lighter than virtualization
   + Performance
     - Netflix doing incredible work on packet pumping
   + Old hardware that has to continue running
     - There's probably a version of BSD that runs what you have
     - https://www.netbsd.org/ports/ (Multiple tiers)
     - http://www.openbsd.org/plat.html
     - https://www.freebsd.org/platforms/
   + You hate systemd ;-)
** When You Shouldn't Use BSD
   + Same answer as for Linux: When it's not in the customer's or employer's best interest
   + Our job as sysadmin, developers and open-source advocates is to meet the customer's need
   + There are nearly always open source solutions to the customer's problem
   + Customer has to be able to use and maintain the solution after we're gone
