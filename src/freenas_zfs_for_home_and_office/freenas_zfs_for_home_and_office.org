* Why FreeNAS Rather than $NAS
** Why FreeNAS?
   + Jails and ZFS
** Jails
   + Not mentioned as a feature of FreeNAS but integral
   + Core to plugin-functionality
   + Not limited to plugin architecture
   + What are jails?
** What are Jails?
   + Process isolation:
     - Full OS
     - Separate network stack
     - Own users and groups (including root)
     - Own processes
     - Unable to access other jails outside of normal network access
   + More than just chroot
   + Lighter than full OS virtualization
   + One kernel to rule them all...
   + Very mature, appearing in FreeBSD 4.0
   + Similar to Solaris Containers
   + More than a Docker container
** Jails in FreeNAS
   + Used for plugin-architecture
   + Each plugin runs in a jail
   + One ipv4 address per jail
   + Neat, clean separation between each plugin
   + Yes, you can run docker-images in a FreeNAS jail

** What is ZFS?
   + Not mentioned as a feature of FreeNAS but integral
   + Combined file system and logical volume manager
   + Focused on:
     - Data protection
     - High (insane) storage capacity
     - Efficient data compression
     - Continuous integrity checking and repair
     - RAID-Z layouts
     - Native CIFS, NFS and ACLs
   + Originally ZFS as in Zettabyte File System
   + Now ZFS as in "last" file system (you'll need)
   + Cross platform
     - http://open-zfs.org
** What is ZFS? - Features
   + Data Datasets
     - Partition and mount-point management
     - Snapshot target
   + COW - Copy On Write
   + Snapshots
   + Metadata
     - Data about the dataset
     - User can create metadata
   + RAID (0,1,10, RAIDZ[1-3])
     - RAIDZn - number of disks for parity
     - Hotswap (AHCI or other hotswap hardware)
   + Replication
     - zfs end | receive
     - Save/restore to/from file
   + File-backed devices
** Snapshots - So What?
   + Exact replica of file table at moment in time
   + Nearly instantaneous, even for large data sets
   + Recursive
   + Enabled by COW
     -Block-level changes only
   + Conceptually similar to a diff
     - More flexible since block level
     - ZFS doesn't need to know file format
   + Can be aged out (using cron)
** ZFS in FreeNAS
   + Heart and primary differentiator of FreeNAS
   + Used for drive and volume management
   + Snapshots
   + Key part of jails
* Conclusion
** Is FreeNAS for Home Use?
   + Yes! And business, SOHO to Enterprise
   + Numerous sites with servers in the 100s of TBs
   + Houses like mine
   + FreeNAS forums chock-a-block with home and SOHO users talking about ITX-based systems
** Hardware (Minimum) Requirements
   + Multi-core 64-bit processor
   + 8 GB boot drive
     - Thumb drives welcome, encouraged
   + 8 GB of RAM
   + At least 1 storage disk
     - Multiple strongly encouraged
   + FAQ
     - Doesn't ZFS require ECC RAM.
       + No. ECC helps with data integrity in the data center
       + Nice to hvae
     - I heard I need 32 GB+ of RAM. Do I?
       + 32 GB+ is nice because you get more read-caching
       + 8 GB is enough
