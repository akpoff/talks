* Introduction
* What is authpf?
** What is authpf?
   + AUTHPF(8) man page:
     - authpf is a user shell for authenticating gateways. It is used
       to change pf(4) rules when a user authenticates and starts a
       session with sshd(8) and to undo these changes when the user's
       session exits.
** What are the use case for authpf?
   + AUTHPF(8) man page:
     - Typical use would be for a gateway that authenticates users
       before allowing them Internet use, or a gateway that allows
       different users into different places. Combined with properly
       set up filter rules and secure switches, authpf can be used to
       ensure users are held accountable for their network traffic.
** Where does it work?
   + AUTHPF(8) man page:
     - It is meant to be used with users who can connect via ssh(1)
       only, and requires the pf(4) subsystem to be enabled.
* What is pf?
** What is pf?
   + PF(4) is the stateful firewall built into OpenBSD and ported to
     several other BSDs including Mac OS X.
   + It has a simple grammar that's very powerful and easy to write
     rules in.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash

   #
   # See pf.conf(5) and /etc/examples/pf.conf

   set skip on lo

   block return    # block stateless traffic
   pass            # establish keep-state
   pass on enc0

   # By default, do not permit remote connections to X11
   block return in on ! lo0 proto tcp to port 6000:6010

* Configuring your server to work with authpf
** Configuring your server to work with authpf
   + Create a user and set their shell to /usr/sbin/authpf
   + Add simple rules to /etc/pf.conf
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
   # rules for authpf
   table <authpf_users> persist

   pass in quick on egress inet proto tcp from <authpf_users> \
       to port $mail_ports rdr-to lo0
#+END_SRC
   + Reload rules: pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf

* Why not use a VPN?
** Why not use a VPN?
   + No special software required
     - At least for *nix-based systems, or perhaps BSD, ssh is already
       installed
   + authpf is not necessarily an inbound port lock/unlock tool
     - Can be used for outbound port blocking
     - http(s)
     - telnet
     - ftp
   + Quick to setup, at least on an OpenBSD box
