# Why lock the Screen when a Mouse is Attached?

With the rise of full-disk encryption you can't just grab the disk out
of a computer and get to the data. You need it running, and logged in,
which means you need to snatch it remove the user while they're using
it.

Once snatched, you insert a mouse jiggler to "move" the mouse every
few seconds to simulate activity and prevent the lockscreen from
activating.





# System Hardening - Encryption

Disk drives are not the only area where encryption matters:

- Some data should be encrypted at rest (*e.g.*, passwords)

Encryption is also critical for on-the-go backups and recovery:

- Learn to use OpenSSH features like **ProxyJump (-J)**.


# What's ProxyJump (-J)?

Ever wondered how to connect to your host on the other side of the
firewall? **ProxyJump**

```
  Setting this option will cause ssh(1) to connect to
  the target host by first making a ssh(1) connection
  to the specified ProxyJump host and then establishing
  a TCP forwarding to the ultimate target from there.
```

Yes, you can make multiple jumps with a comma-delimited list of
ProxyJump hosts.





# What do these questions have to do with backups?

Disaster recovery planning is more than making backups.

- Knowing what can going wrong and how affects how your prepare
- But don't spend ages considering every possibility
- Take a defense in depth approach
- Security isn't a destination ... it's a process





# Machine Physical Security - OS

If your OS supports it:

- Consider a `cron(8)` job that hibernates the computer every night.
  It's hard to hack past full-disk encryption.
- Lock the screen on insertion and maybe removal of USB HIDs
  (human-interface devices) like keyboards and mice.

*N.B.* If you're on OpenBSD, I wrote `hotplugd(8)` attach and remove
scripts that start `xlock(1)` when HID devices are inserted or
removed.
