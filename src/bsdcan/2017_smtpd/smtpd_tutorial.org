* Tutorial Goals and Prerequisites
** Tutorial Goals
   * Configure smtpd as a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for single and multi-domain use
   * Install a certificate and configure smtpd to provide or require TLS
   * Accept or reject mail based on criteria like recipient, source, sender and domain
   * Tag mail
   * Configure Spam Assassin
   * Configure ClamAV
   * Configure smtpd to work with Spam Assassin, ClamAV and
     Local-Mail-Transfer-Protocol (LMTP) services (in series or
     individually)
** Tutorial Goals
   * Use a database with OpenSMTPD and Dovecot for managing virtual
     users
   * Sign Outbound Email with DKIMProxy
   * Deliver mail to Dovecot
   * Troubleshoot smtpd issues using smtpd's syntax checker, logs and
     by sending mail manually via telnet
** Tutorial Prerequisites
   + One of the supported OSs
     - Unless you want to port it to your OS ;-)
     - /N.B./ - If you brought a Linux box to the tutorial you will be
       heckled ;-)
   + Amavisd (amavisd-new)
   + ClamAV
   + DKIMProxy
   + Dovecot
   + mail/mailx
   + OpenSMTPD
   + OpenSSL/LibreSSL
   + SpamAssasin
** Tutorial Prerequisites
   + Spamd
   + SQLite3
   + Optional but Recommended:
     - OpenBGPD
* OpenSMTPD
** OpenSMPTD Overview
   + Current version: 6.0.2, released 2016-10-13
   + man smtpd(8):
     - History: The smtpd program first appeared in OpenBSD 4.6.
   + Started by Gilles Chehade in late 2008
   + ISC license
   + Primarily developed by:
     - Gilles Chehade, Eric Faurot, Charles Longeau and Sunil Nimmagadda
     - And cast of others
   + Portable version begun by Charles Longeau
   + Found on:
     - NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD, Mac OS X, Linux
** OpenSMTPD Overview - Notes
   + OpenSMDTP scrupulously follows RFCs
     - It's a good idea
     - Spammers don't ... extra layer of protection
   + If you're trying a manual process (/e.g./, sending mail
     manually via telnet) and it fails, you're probably doing it
     incorrectly. /E.g.:/
     - Correct:   rcpt to:<user@domain>
     - Incorrect: rcpt to:user@domain
     - Incorrect: rcpt to: <user@domain>
     - Incorrect: rcpt to: user@domain
** Important Keywords
   + include
   + Macros
   + table
   + pki
   + listen
   + tag
   + accept|reject
   + deliver
   + userbase
   + Refer to example in etc/mail/smtpd.conf
** Important Keywords - Macros
   - Expanded in context
   - Names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore, and may
     contain any of those characters
   - May not be reserved words
   - /N.B./ - Macros are not expanded within quotation marks!
** Important Keywords - table
   + Use to provide additional configuration information:
     - Lists or key-value mappings
   + Types: db or file
   + May also be inlined with comma-separated values (list or key=value)
** Important Keywords - pki
   + Several uses for this keyword:
     - Specify a given hostname with a specific certile
     - Specify a key file for a specific certfile
     - Specify which certificate to present in a *listen* directive
     - Specify which certificate to present in a *relay* directive

** Important Keywords - listen
   + Specify a socket or an interface for incoming connections
   + Multiple listeners may be specified
   + May specify:
     - hostname to present in the greeting banner
       + default is server name or name in ${ETC}/mail/mailname
     - port
     - tls/ssl requirements
     - address family (inet4 | inet6)
     - directives to tag traffic
** Negate [!]
   + ! negates the sense of the rule
   + Shown as [!] in man pages and tutorial where optional
** Important Keywords - accept|reject
   + Accept or reject messages based on SMTP session info
   + Criteria for evaluation:
     - tagged [!] tag-name: tag applied as part of client session from
       any: match all

     - from [!] local: match only local connections (default, not
       necessary)

     - from [!] source <table>: match connections from clients whose
       address is declared in the specified table

     - sender [!] <senders>: match senders email address found in
       table *senders*. Address may specify entire domain with @:
       @example.org
** Important Keywords - accept|reject
   + Criteria for evaluation:
     - for any [alias <aliases>]: Match regardless of the domain sent
       to. If an alias table is specified, lookup alternative
       destination for all addresses.

     - for any virtual <vmap>: match regardless of domain sent to,
       lookup virtual-domain mapping in table *vmap*.

     - for [!] domain *domain* [alias <aliases>]: Match based on
       specified *domain*. If an alias table is specified, lookup
       alternative destination for all addresses.

     - for [!] domain <domain> [alias <aliases>]: Match based on
       domains specified table *domain*. If an alias table is
       specified, lookup alternative destination for all addresses.

     - for [!] local [alias <aliases>]: Match messages destined for
       localhost. If an alias table is specified, lookup alternative
       destination for all addresses.

     - for [!] local virtual <vmap>: Match mail destined to localhost.
       The *vmap* table will be used as the virtual domain mapping.
** Important Keywords - accept|reject
   + Criteria for evaluation:
     - virtual <users> may be used with each of the above rather than
       alias <aliases>.

     - recipient [!] <recipients>: Match only if the recipient's email
       address is found table *recipients*.
   
     - [userbase <table>]: Look-up users in table *table* instead of
       looking users up using getpwnam(3).
** Important Keywords - deliver
   + Specify where the mail is to be delivered.
   + deliver to lmtp [host:port | socket] [rcpt-to] [as user]: Deliver
     mail via lmtp protocol.
     - lmtp - queue-less version of SMTP protocol. Useful for sending
       to MDAs or filter applications like amavisd.
   + deliver to maildir [path]: Deliver to maildir directory. Default
     is ~/Maildir.
   + delivery to mbox: Deliver mail to system mailbox in /var/mail.
   + deliver to mda program [as user]: Pipe mail to specified program.
     Optionally run mda as specified *user*.
** OpenSMTPD Configuration
   + man smtpd.conf(5)
   + Simple, English-like syntax very similar to PF and other
     OpenBSD-projects
   + Typical ${ETC}/mail/smtpd.conf
   + May reference other configuration files
     - include "/etc/mail/smtpd.conf.local"
   + See example in etc/mail/smtpd.conf in tarball
* PF
** PF Overview
   + man pf(4)
     - History: The pf packet filtering mechanism first appeared in
       OpenBSD 3.0.
   + Packet Filter (PF) is OpenBSD's system for filtering TCP/IP
     traffic and doing Network Address Translation. PF is also capable
     of normalizing and conditioning TCP/IP traffic, as well as
     providing bandwidth control and packet prioritization.
   + Originally written by Daniel Hartmeier and is now maintained and
     developed by the entire OpenBSD team.
   + Ported to:
     - FreeBSD (somewhat incompatible now), NetBSD, Mac OS X
     - Oracle (seriously ... and doing really good work on SMP!)
** PF Configuration
   + Need to add a few rules
   + See rules subset in etc/pf.conf in tarball
* SPF_Fetch
** SPF_Fetch
   + Find outbound mailers for domains by recursively searching their
     DNS SPF records
   + Written by Aaron Poffenberger
   + Two scripts: spf_fetch and spf_update_pf
   + sp_fetch
     - Recursively finds SPF records for domains in file parameter
   + spf_update_pf
     - Automates process of adding to pf
     - Pipes `spf_fetch ${ETC}/mail/common_domains` to
       common_domains_white
     - Loads ${ETC}/mail/common_domains_white into <common_white>
       table in PF
   + See git repo in spf_fetch in tarball
   + See crontab sample in cronjobs in tarball
** SPF_Fetch - Coming Soon
   + Scan log for outbound email connections
   + IPV6 support
   + Watch https://github.com/akpoff/spf_fetch for updates
* BGP-Spamd
** BGP-Spamd - Overview
   + Distribution of whitelist and blacklist IPs using bgp protocol.
   + BGP: purpose is to exchange information concerning "network
     reachability" with other BGP systems.
   + Project run by Peter Hessler (phessler@ OpenBSD)
   + Receives blacklist and whitelist data from several sources,
     including Peter Hansteen
   + Works with pf and spamd
     - pf by modifying a specific white-list table
     - spamd by creating file create by a cron job
** BGP-Spamd - Configuration
   + ${ETC}/bgpd.conf
   + Select a private AS id (autonomous system): default == 65001
   + Un-comment a neighbor close to you
   + Add pass rule to ${ETC}/pf.conf
   + See rules subset in etc/pf.conf in tarball
** BGP-Spamd - Configuration
   + Add source to ${ETC}/mail/spamd.conf
   + See bgp-spamd/bgp-spamd.black.sh in tarbarll
   + See example in etc/mail/spamd.conf in tarball
** BGP-Spamd Cron Job
   + Add line to root crontab
   + See crontab sample in cronjobs in tarball
* Amavisd Overview
** Amavisd Overview
   + amavisd-new is a high-performance interface between mailer (MTA)
     and content checkers: virus scanners, and/or SpamAssassin
   + Runs as a service
   + Manages sending email through multiple services like ClamAV and
     SpamAssassin
   + Supports LMTP or (E)SMTP
   + LMTP is a queue-less counterpart to SMTP
     - Which raises the question: How do I ensure my mail isn't lost
       while it's in the LMTP receiver?
     - Several solutions possible. Amavisd does not return success to
       the caller until it has delivered the mail to the next hop.
     - https://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/#sec-loss
** Amavisd - Configuration
   + Amavisd configuration file is a dog's breakfast
   + Fortunately, just a few changes are *necessary*
     - Lots of optional dials and knobs
   + See example in etc/amavisd.conf in tarball
* ClamAV
** ClamAV - Overview
   + ClamAV is an open source antivirus engine for detecting trojans,
     viruses, malware & other malicious threats.
   + Runs as a service or can be called ad-hoc
   + Includes freshclam service to download up-to-date definitions
** ClamAV - Configuration
   + Just a few changes are *necessary*
     - Lots of optional dials and knobs
   + See example in etc/clamd.conf in tarball
   + See example in etc/freshclam.conf in tarball
   + /N.B./ - Must comment out word "Example" near top of file!
     - Already done in example in tarball
* DKIMProxy
** DKIMProxy - Overview
   + Perl module that implements the new Domain Keys Identified Mail
     (DKIM) standard
   + Can sign and verify emails using digital signatures and DNS records
   + Also an SMTP-proxy that signs and/or verifies emails
     - Designed for Postfix but works with any MTA that supports LMTP
** DKIMProxy_in - Verify
   + Option to handle in Amavisd
     - Could enable DKIMProxy_in, but why?
     - Amavisd already orchestrates email validation
** DKIMProxy_out - Sign
   + Generate TLS signing key
     - openssl genrsa -out private/dkim_exmple.org.key 4096
     - chmod 400 private/dkim_exmple.org.key
     - Ensure daemon user for dkimproxy_out has access to private key
   + Get public key from private
     - openssl rsa -in private/dkim_example.org.key
   + Update DNS records to add public key
     - See var/nsd/etc/db.example.org
* Dovecot
** Dovecot - Overview
   + Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for
     Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in mind.
   + High performance
   + Standards compliant
   + Plugin architecture
** Dovecot - Configuration
   + Very easy to configure
   + Edit file ${ETC}/dovecot/local.conf to override default settings
   + Virtual user password algorithm option identical to OpenSMTPD
   + See example in etc/dovecot/local.conf in tarball
   + See example in etc/dovecot/passwd in tarball
* SpamAssassin
** SpamAssassin - Overview
   + Open Source anti-spam platform giving system administrators a
     filter to classify email and block spam (unsolicited bulk email)
   + It uses a robust scoring framework and plug-ins to integrate a
     wide range of advanced heuristic and statistical analysis tests
     on email headers and body text including text analysis, Bayesian
     filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases
** SpamAssassin - Configuration
   + Not many *necessary* changes
     - Lots of optional dials and knobs
   + Most notably, the option: /trusted_networks/
     - Not critical, but will exclude mail from listed addresses from
       checking
