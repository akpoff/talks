# Motivation

- That time I nuked the disklabel
- Increasing amount and importance of data on laptops


# Goals

- Reliable, fast backups at rest and on the go
- Easy to access and restore while travelling
- Sync `$HOME` with other systems
- Tools available in base or packages
- No compromise on security


# What is a Disaster?

For my purposes, a disaster is any event that prevents me from using my
laptop or accessing the data I need.


# Disasters Travellers Face

- Hardware failure
- Theft
- Confiscation
- User mistakes, ahem, `dd(1)`


# Disaster Recovery Planning

Some questions I considered when developing my disaster recovery plan.


# Who am I in the world?

- CEO, CTO, CFO
- System Administrator
- Developer
- Journalist, activist, dissident, gadfly


# What sensitive data do I have?

- Source code
- Access codes
- Customer data


# What access do I have that someone might want?

- Admin/root
- Personal or employer banking details
- Social media accounts
- Customer VPN credentials
- Commit bit to an interesting project


# How is that hardware, sensitive data, or access at risk?

- Thieves, fraudsters, et al. looking for a quick buck
- Competitors
- Nation states
- Manufacturers (hardware failure)
- Self ("I left my laptop on the plane.")


# My Answers

- I'm a Developer
- Who carries mostly personal data
- With:
   - root access to personal and customer servers
   - Personal banking details
   - Social media accounts
- Whose data is mostly interesting to, or at risk from:
   - Thieves, fraudsters, et al.
   - Maybe to some competitors
   - My own mistakes or hardware failures


# Preparation and Operation

With those answers in mind, I began looking at how best to prepare for
the inevitable disaster.


# System Hardening - BIOS

The first step was hardening the laptop at the BIOS level to provide
tamper evidence, and to prevent surreptitious access.

- Bottom cover open warning
- Supervisor password
- Boot OS drive only, require supervisor password to boot USB disks,
  CD ROMs or PXE


# System Hardening - Full-Disk Encryption

Full-disk encryption is the lynchpin of the disaster recovery plan. It
provides:

- Peace of mind if the computer goes missing
- Reduces anxiety about throwing out old hard drives or computers


# System Hardening - OS

- Set `AllowUsers` or `AllowGroups` in `sshd_config(5)`
- All user-editable config files maintained separately and installed
  with `rdist(1)`.
- `/usr/sbin/apm -Z` in `crontab(1)` to hibernate daily \   
  Because it's hard to hack past full-disk encryption.
- `hotplugd(8)` script to lock the screen on insertion of USB HIDs
  (human-interface devices) like keyboards and mice.


# Excursus on Trusting USB HID Devices

- Why not?
- They're user-input devices. Almost any microcontroller can present
  itself as an HID device and do anything a user can: type, move the
  mouse, and can do those things forever
- What stops the lock screen on your computer from starting? User
  input.
- *C.f.* Mouse Jiggler


# Disaster Planning - Two Sides

After a disaster the first question everyone asks is:

```
  How do we recover from it?
```

But there are two sides to every disaster. The other question to ask
is:

```
  What happened to the data on the systems in
  the disaster?
```

Recovery is important, but it's just important to ensure no one can
benefit from the disaster.


# Excursus on Failing Safely

Make sure family can still get into the computer and password manager
if something catasrophic happens to you. The goal is to recover from
disaster and keep the bad actors out, not (necessarily) loved ones.

It's a lot like estate planning. You have to prepare for others take
over.


# Preparation and Operation

With the laptop and OS hardened, I turned to synchronization and
backups.


# Data Synchronization

Repeat after me: "Synchronization is not a backup strategy."
\   
\   
\   
But it's still useful for syncing data with other systems, and for
getting a current copy of `$HOME` after disaster recovery.


# Data Synchronization

For synchronization I chose Unison via `ssh(1)`.

- Custom script in `crontab(1)` that calls `unison` every `n` minutes
   - `$HOME` only
   - Script implements a mutex to prevent more than one run
- `ssh-keygen(1)` signing certificate
- Add "TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub" to `sshd_config(5)`
- Entry in `ssh_config(5)` to ensure connectivity at home and away
   - Use `ssh` `ProxyJump` to traverse firewall


# What's ProxyJump (-J)?

Ever wondered how to connect to your host on the other side of the
firewall? **ProxyJump**

```
  Setting this option will cause ssh(1) to connect to
  the target host by first making a ssh(1) connection
  to the specified ProxyJump host and then establishing
  a TCP forwarding to the ultimate target from there.
```

Yes, you can make multiple jumps with a comma-delimited list of
ProxyJump hosts.


# ssh_config

```
  Host fw
     HostKeyAlias fw.tld
  Match Host fw !exec "host fw" 
     HostName <static_ip>

  Host homenas
     HostKeyAlias homenas.tld
  Match Host homenas !exec "host homenas"
     ProxyJump proxy@fw
```


# Backups

Repeat after me: Replication is not the same as an offline backup.
\   
\   
\   
*C.f.*: [The Untold Story of NotPetya]


# Backups

For remote backups I use `rsync` to copy key directories to remote
server with a snapshotting filesystem:

- Custom script in `crontab(1)` to call `rsync` every `n` hours
   - `$HOME`, `/root`, `/var`, `/usr/src`, `/usr/ports`, `/usr/xenocara`
- Uses same entries in `ssh_config(5)`, and signing certificate as
  above


# Backups

Recently switched from `rsync` to `dump(8)` for on-the-go backups to a
separate partition at the end of my hard drive, mounted at
`/var/dump`, then replicated to online and offline media.

- Runs every `n` minutes, no longer depends on drive insertion
- Still carry separate ssd, to replicate to
- Moved data that rarely changes to partition to avoid dumping (e.g.,
  ebooks)
- `hotplugd(8)` `attach` script that checks whether the DUID of inserted
  media is in the list of known `softraid(4)` crypto disks, attaches the
  disk, mounts the volume, makes a backup of the dumps, unmounts, and
  deletes the volume.


# Why dump(8)?

Much better choice for incremental backups. `rsync` can be twisted
into doing incremental copies, but it's built-in to `dump` (-0 -- -9),
managed by entries in `/etc/dumpdates`.

Also, `restore(8)` can restore the entire drive, or any subset.

Disadvantages: multiple passes to fully recover:

- count = last dump level + 1
- *E.g.*, `dump -2` will require 3 restore sessions, levels 0 through 2


# Localhost Security

Yes, I store some passwords in the clear on the box. *E.g.*,
`softraid(4)` crypto passwords. It's a single-user system.  The files
are `chown`'d and `chmod`'d.
\   
\   
\   
If bad actors are on my computer and can read files in
`/etc/ssl/private/`, I have bigger problems than a few FDE passwords
lying around.


# Disaster Recovery

Requires some preparation. Very hard to do without preparation, but
possible, depending on the disaster.
\   
\   
\   
*C.f.*: [That Time I Nuked the Disklabel]


# Disaster Recovery

- OS Install Drive
- Recent backup (optional, but very encouraged)
   - `rsync`ing 100GB across hotel wifi hurts
- Use `restore(8)`


# Disaster Recovery - OS Install Drive

OpenBSD *-current* - **with** necessary firmware
\   
\   
I've written a script that opens a copy of `install.fs`, and adds the
necessary files (*e.g.*, firmware), and `autoinstall(8)` answer file
to do unattended install, re-packages it ready to `dd` to a thumb
drive.

Need to add disklabel from `sd0` for those cases where I can restore
from `dump` partition.
\   
\   
Working to integrate with backup drive.


# Recovery Steps

Installing OpenBSD takes < 10 minutes.
\   
\   

Mount recovery partition, or backup drive. Run `restore(8)` to recover
files.

\   
\   
And now that we have `sysupgrade(8)`, I can pick-up any changes
since my OS install disk was last created.
\   
\   
Finally, once that's complete, I run `unison` to pick-up the latest
synchronized files, `et voilÃ `, I'm done.


# Does it Work?

Yes, quite well.
\   
\   
\   
I recently took trip 500 miles from home with nothing but a laptop
running Windows and my recovery disks. Came back with a laptop running
OpenBSD and all my data.


# Does it Work in a Pinch?

Tweet from Tuesday night of this week:
\    
\    
```
Last night at 21:40 I typed:

`dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/rsd0c bs=1m`

Not only did I nuke my #OpenBSD install, but the #fde
container as well.

What else would you do some 17 hours before your flight
to #vBSDCon to talk about "Road Warrior Disaster
Recovery"?
```


# Does it Work in a Pinch?

I reloaded the OS, went to bed, and finished the restore in the
morning ... after breakfast, ~ 08:30

I left for the airport at 12:00.


# Preparing to Cross International Borders

International travel poses special, significant risks to travellers.
The threat of confiscation of phones, laptops, and other digital
devices can give one pause when travelling.
\   
\   
\   
How do we travel safely?


# A Good Disaster-Recovery Plan Breeds Confidence

Given the reliability of the system I've crafted for myself, I feel no
hesitance about purposely running:

```
  dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/rsd0c bs=1M count=3
```

Or carrying Windows restore media with me and reverting the computer
to an OS border patrol would recognize and understand.


# Other Options

If nuking the disklabel is too scary, consider paring down the amount
and scope of data you travel with:

- Can you archive financial records from years past?
- Can you store current financial records on system that doesn't
  travel?
- Do you need to carry all those passwords while you travel?
\   

Or consider carrying a "dumb terminal" laptop with you and connecting
to a remote system.


# How Can I Get Started?

Start backing up. Something, anything that's off computer is a good
start:

- `borg backup`
- `dump`
- `rsync`
- `syncthing`
- `tarsnap`
- Your favorite


# Caveats

Test your backups. I would **not** recommend waiting until your 500
miles from home to test your recovery system.

It takes practice to develop the confidence necessary to trust your
backup system.

Have multiple backups. I usually carry two copies with me, plus
backups at home, and a critical subset at a cloud provider.
